Hi! I'm a PhD student currently working at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Skylaris](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x2r2f/professor-chris-skylaris). My research interests include computational chemistry, electrochemistry, and catalysis.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physical Chemistry from the [University of Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr) which I completed in 2018. In 2020 I graduated from the [European Master in Advanced Spectroscopy in Chemistry](https://master-asc.eu) at the [Jagiellonian University](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) in KrakÃ³w via the Erasmus Mundus program.

Mostly, I love problem-solving and learning new things. I'm always looking for new opportunities and challenges (I used to spend quite a bit of time on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/tom_dmre)). I also enjoy working on open-source projects and contributing to the scientific community.

This is a picture of my girlfriend Emilie and me! We are both passionate about science and we are both doing a PhD in the UK at the University of Southampton. She is working on the development of resistive memories using Polyoxometalates and hopefully will have a blog

[comment]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
