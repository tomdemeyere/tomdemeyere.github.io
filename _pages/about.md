Hi! I am a Research Scientist currently working at [BAM](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/DE/Home/home.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Janine George](https://jageo.github.io). In practice, I am a Material Scientist with experience working with computational methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) to study the properties of materials at the atomic level. I am currently working on the development of computational workflows to study and understand multi-center bonds in materials.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physical Chemistry from the [University of Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr) which I completed in 2018. In 2020 I graduated from the [European Master in Advanced Spectroscopy in Chemistry](https://master-asc.eu) at the [Jagiellonian University](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) in Krak√≥w via the Erasmus Mundus program. More recently, I completed my PhD in Chemistry at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk) in 2024, where I worked on understanding the mechanisms of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) in fuel cells using advanced computational methods. You can find my publications in the [publications section](/publications/).

Mostly, I love problem-solving and learning new things, I used to spend quite a bit of time on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/tom_dmre). I'm always looking for new opportunities and challenges in working on open-source projects and contributing to the scientific community. On this page you will find a picture of my partner Emilie and me! We are both passionate about science, as she is also a PhD holder in Chemistry, please check out her [website](https://egerou.github.io)!
